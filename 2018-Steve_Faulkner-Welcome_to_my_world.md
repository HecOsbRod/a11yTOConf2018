## Interoperability needs to be fixed
- In browsers
- In assistive tech
- In coding practices & understanding
- In specs

## I concentrate on: 
- Screen Readers 
- A11y APIs 
- HTML semantics 
- ARIA & HTML

**Accessibility is about many things, many aspects. Not everyone can know everything!**

## Accessibility APIs
*ARIA should be used sparingly, don't use it if you don't need to.*
