## Links style
- focus, active, visited, hover

## CSS rules
- `form: focus-within`
- Highlight tables that are highlighted.
- `a:focus-visible` (pseudoclass) [Verify in caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=focus-visible)


> The web is more than mouse and keyboard!

- Browser sniffing still happens.

## The following notes were taken by: [Quimana Boots](https://github.com/qymanab/a11yTO-Confb)
* Is it beautiful? Is it useful?
* The web is NOT print and should not be treated as such
* Focus styles
  * affordances
  * give multiple affordances
  * Use CSS to overwrite default hover states
  * All states should be distinct
* Identify and activate
  * Don’t shift the layout
  * CHECK HIGH CONTRAST MODE
* New ways to focus
  * Focus-within and focus-visible
  * Focus-visible
* Activate, don’t identify
* Concerns
  * repeating mistakes of browser sniffing
  * sharing PII without knowing how it will be used
  * Bad design decisions made in good faith
  * Being forced into an AT-onlly companion experience
* Embrace the Unknown
  * Good UX meets user where they are
