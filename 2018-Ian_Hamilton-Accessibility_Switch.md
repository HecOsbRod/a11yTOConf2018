# Accessibility Switch 

Speaker: Ian Hamilton

Games can really profoundly **change people's lives**  
Games represent access to culture and socializing. 

Why games?  
Candy Crush is a great example of color blindness disability.. Until they introduced the bombs.

Input device (control) complexities increases the complexity of the game 

How to make game accessible?  
1. Communicate information in more than one way
2. Allow some flexibility in how the game is played
