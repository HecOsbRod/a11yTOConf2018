## What's Neurodivergent (ND)?
* A brain that functions different from dominant societal standards of “normal”
* $emoves negative connotation
* Examples:
  * ADHD
  * Autism
  * Dyslexia
  * Bipolar
- It's not about being better or worse
- Because I have an invisible disability you don't know that I hit my hand on the keyboard everyday with barriers


## WCAG for cognitive disabilities
- Not a lot that’s specific for CD/ND, some stuff helps but nothing really specific
  - Very complex, people are very different
  - Non interference
- Level A & AA, are they enough?
- If we just do the bare minimum standard, we're not doing enough
- Do you want to be in a building that meets minimum fire criteria?

## Assistive Tech (AT)
* Dyslexia/dyscalulia
  * Spell checker
  * Voice to Text
  * Copy / Paste
  * Screen readers
* ADHD/ADD
    * Read only mode
    * Ad blocker
    * Autocomplete
    * Captions

## Moving Content
- For example: Chat bot, pop ups, modals
  - Not talking about Microinteractions...
  - Things that move and don’t stop and things that jump out
  - Moving ads are barriers
- WCAG 2.1 AAA 
- Micro interactions are great for some users

## Subtitles: Language processing
- Should not be paraphrasing - Should be exactly what’s being said on screen

## Voice to Text: distraction
- Becomes something that fills that void when you can't speak the language. 
- Make sure form fields can use voice to text! (FORMS)
- Google docs voice to text feature

## Display password: Working Memory
- Remember Me & Autocomplete
- “Show password”

## Plugin
- LastPass (remember password) 
- [https://www.lastpass.com/](https://www.lastpass.com/)

## Notes
- If it makes the exchange of information better for all users, it's probably make or break for users that are ND
- If you’re looking for users, Users with CD/ ND are on twitter and they’re loud
