## Bring assistive technology training to seniors  

#### We've learned interested things in assistive technology:
- We all think about assistive technology as aging
- Inclusive design is not inclusive if you can't access it!
Setup, maintenance, security, updating and upgrading are often access barriers

- When you become disabled at later age, there are more barriers. Emotionally coping becomes harder.
	- You have to process the trauma of disability onset in order to code well. 

User Centered Accessibility Tests:  
- I cannot access this  
- I need help to access this  
- This is accessible to me (now)  


Assistive tech instruction for seniors to deal with the trauma of late onset disability and/or traumatic change in user experienceâ€¦.

Training for seniors:  
	- Don't talk tech jargon  
	- Think deeply about each step of the process with whatever app you're creating. 

What's a good website?  
	- Text size/style and layout 
	- Color and contrast   
	- UI and navigation: streamlined and easy-to-remember navigation and location reference points  
	- Mouse and keyboard use  
	- Forms (save and continue later feature for forms)
	
	
Don't make me hunt down my mouse in a mass of text
