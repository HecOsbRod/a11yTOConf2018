## 3 outline principles for broadening horizons:
### 1- Minimum compliance approach:
- Using baseline accessibility standards as the only method for inclusive design.

### 2- Move past the minimum
- What do I know about disability?
- What do I do not know?
- Inclusive design calls for inclusive research.

### 3- Reassess:
- Redefine. Adapt your process for users of all abilities.
