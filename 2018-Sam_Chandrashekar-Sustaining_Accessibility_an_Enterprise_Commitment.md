*Accessibility is dynamic and with adding new things there is a risk of losing it/*

## Accessibility Education:
- It's not a static state
- It's not a checklist
- A11y is vulnerable

## Sustaining accessibility: 
- It's a process, it's a process of keeping, attempting to keep our sites accessible.
- It is the responsibility of every organization to sustain the accessibility that its designers, developers and others work hard to attain.

## Risks to Accessibility: 
1. Critical employee turnover 
2. Inadequate accessibility training (onboarding training - no accessibility training) 
3. Changes in regulatory requirements 
4. Inadequate oversight in product management 
5. Loss of technology interoperability

## Management of Risks:
### 1. Employee turnover
- Software is a dynamic field.

**Challenge:**
- How do we externalize intrinsic knowledge?

**Suggestion:**
- Promote active internal discussion channels for problem solving. (Example use of SLACK). 

### 2. Accessibility training (or lack of)
- Research, design, development, testing, product management, support

**Challenge:**
- How do we provide useful and usable training resources?

**Suggestion:**
- Just in time learning, where the pieces of information are there to be used.

### 3. Regulatory changes
- How do we create accessibility SMEs across the organization?
- Promote collaborative authoring of knowledge base articles.

## Organizational Commitments: 
1. Prioritize accessibility as a core value 
2. Support employees in creating knowledge assets 
3. Invest in infrastructure for knowledge management
