- Mike Ervin is the @smartasscrip  
- Is there humor in music


Interoperability should needs to be fixed:  
- In browsers
- In assistive tech
- In coding practices & understanding
- In specs

I concentrate on:  
- Screen Readers
- A11y APIs
- HTML semantics
- ARIA & HTML

Accessibility is about many things, many aspects. Not every can know everything!

** Accessibility APIs

ARIA should be used sparingly, don't use it if you don't need to.
