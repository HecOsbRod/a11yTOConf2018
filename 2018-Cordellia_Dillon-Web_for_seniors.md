# Everything I learned about interaction design I learned in the senior center computer lab

- A lot of technology is created by young abled-bodied people.
- As we age our senses are not the same.

## Feasibility
- Are interfaces and interactions physically accessible?

## Meaning
- Are iconography, terminology and concepts familiarly or explained

## Navigation
- Are navigation patters consistent and intuitive

## Issues Examples
### 1. Mobility
- Double Click
- Brings issues of accuracy
- Users with arthritis or mobility issues.

**Design Principles Flexibility**
- User has options, can interact in the way that works best for them
- No time dependence: user can work at their own pace, free of any time-based pressure

### 2. Tapping the button you didn't mean to (iPad)
- Solution: large tap areas
- Generous margins between actions
- Consider action order and general layout (trash icon)
- Not knowing where the field ends (form fields)
- Should I tab on label, on field, where does the field ends? (for field without surrounding box)

**Design Principle: Wiggle room**
- User doesn't have to be too precise

**Design Principle: Tolerance for error**
- User can easily recover from mistakes

> "Easy to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing"

### 3. Finding Icons
- Menu under a triangle down arrow icon
- Who might this affect?
- Users with low vision
- Users with zoom
- Screens with varying brightness, color balance, or resolution.

***Solutions***
- Stronger color contrast
- Tooltips

***Design principle***
- Findability
- Legibility

> Use a crappy/old projector for colour contrast testing.

### 4. Iconography
- Discerning meaning without text clues.
- (Icons without text)

*Who might this affect?*
- Touch screen users
- New or infrequent users of apps
- Users unfamiliar with certain web conventions

**Solutions:**
- Include tooltips or other visible text to clarify purpose
- Avoid using same icon for multiple meaning across app (globe icon on Facebook)
- Designer how to test an icon: take it out of context
- Ask any stranger: What do you reckon this icon mean?


**Navigation Pattern**
